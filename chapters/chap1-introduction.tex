\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:1}

The problem considered in this thesis arises from the Kronig-Penney model, see for example \cite[Chap. 3]{heering2002elektrophysik}, which describes an idealised quantum-mechanical system that models a quantum particle behaving as a matter wave moving in one-dimension through an infinite periodic array of rectangular potential barriers, i.e. through a space area in which a potential attains a local maximum. Such an array commonly occurs in models of periodic crystal lattices where the potential is caused by ions in the crystal structure. Those charged molecules create an electromagnetic field around themselves. Hence, any particle moving through such a crystal would be subject to a recurrent electromagnetic potential. Although a solid particle, simplified as a point mass, would be reflected at such a barrier, there is a possibility that the quantum particle, as it behaves like a wave, penetrates the barrier and continues its movement beyond.

Assuming the spacing between all ions is equidistant the potential function $V(x)$ in the lattice can be approximated by a rectangular potential like this:

In this thesis, we are interested in the spectrum of the operator describing the situation of the Kronig-Penney model when the particle moves through periodically distributed, singular potentials. With respect to the above this means taking the limit $b \rightarrow 0$ while $V_{0}$ remains of order $\rho b^{-1}$. We will therefore extend the research in \cite{dorfler2011photonic} about the spectrum of periodic differential operators with smooth coefficients and show that an operator modelling the aforementioned situation has likewise a spectrum that consists of a union of compact intervals in $\R$. 
~\\

The remainder of this thesis is structured as follows. We begin with some preliminaries in chapter 2 to review some concepts from functional analyses and spectral theory. In chapter 3, we will examine the operator and show that its self-adjointness, which is our first step in analysing its spectrum. We proceed in chapter 4 by restricting the problem to its fundamental domain of periodicity. There we are able to analyse the spectrum of the restricted operator by showing the compactness of its resolvent. In chapter 5 we introduce two concepts to transfer the results from the restricted case into the unrestricted, namely the Floquet tranformation and the Bloch waves. Based on this methods, we are able to show in chapter 6 the main result for the one-dimensional case, i.e. such an operator has a spectrum consisting of a union of compact intervals in $\R$, and extrapolate this result to the multi-dimensional case in chapter 7. We close this thesis in chapter 8, where we discuss possible gaps between the compact intervals and list current researches.
